# ECG_disease_classification
Creating models for identifying and classification of important disorders of the heart from electrocardiogram (ECG)

## Project: "11. analyzing medical data for health monitoring"
This project focuses on developing machine learning models for identifying and classifying heart diseases using ECG time series data. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the models will analyze ECG signals to detect abnormalities and classify different types of heart conditions.
